# Parcel is a bundler that does following things 
#
#    • HMR - Hot Module Replacement
#    • Bundling
#    • Minifying
#    • Cleaning code
#    • Super fast build algorithm
#    • Image optimization
#    • Caching while development(eg: First time build takes a few seconds, and subsequent builds, without removing parcel-cache folder, takes about just a few miliseconds)
#    • Compresses files(renames variables, files, etc)
#    • Compatible with old browser versions(It adds polyfills)
#    • Enable HTTPS on dev (eg: npx parcel build index.html --https will build with https)
#    • Manages port number (eg: run two projects at a time on localhost, both will have diff port number)
#    • Consistent Hashing Algorithm to cache things
#    • Zero config bundler
#    • Takes care of transitive dependencies
#    
# JSX uses React.createElement => Object => HTML
# 
# Babel is a js compiler. Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.

#   • Transform Syntax
#   • Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through a third-party polyfill such as core-js)
#   • Source code transformations (codemods)
