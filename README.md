# Parcel is a bundler that does following things 
#
#    • HMR - Hot Module Replacement
#    • Bundling
#    • Minifying
#    • Cleaning code i.e. removes console logs, etc..
#    • Super fast build algorithm
#    • Image optimization
#    • Caching while development(eg: First time build takes a few seconds, and subsequent builds, without removing parcel-cache folder, takes about just a few miliseconds)
#    • Compresses files(renames variables, files, etc)
#    • Compatible with old browser versions(It adds polyfills)
#    • Enable HTTPS on dev (eg: npx parcel build index.html --https will build with https)
#    • Manages port number (eg: run two projects at a time on localhost, both will have diff port number)
#    • Consistent Hashing Algorithm to cache things
#    • Zero config bundler
#    • Takes care of transitive dependencies
#    •
